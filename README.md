# _Overflow_: Variations on Leonard Cohenâ€™s _Suzanne_

Humanity is surprisingly fragile within their own environment. We are tossed around by our daily lives and any gust of wind that passes by. Inspired by Leonard Cohen's "Suzanne," this composition uses Csound to blend electronic and acoustic elements, as electronics have taken over our lives at an unprecedented rate.

For the electronic sounds, pitches and rhythms were chosen primarily with the Koenig algorithm and form the background of the piece. These synthesized tones are complemented by acoustic recordings of whistling and percussive elements, specifically a wooden bucket. The combination of these sounds highlights the delicate balance between human presence and the natural world.

"All men will be sailors then until the sea shall free them." - Leonard Cohen
